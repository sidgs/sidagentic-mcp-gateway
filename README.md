MCPGateway is a self-hosted MCP gateway for developers and teams who want to manage multiple MCP servers without scattered client configurations, duplicated setup, or inconsistent access control.

Use it **locally** to keep your personal MCP setup clean, or run it as **shared infrastructure** for a team with centralized discovery, access control, and observability.

![diagram](./assets/mcpgateway-diagram/april-2026/mcpgateway-diagram.svg)

Instead of wiring every MCP server into every AI client, register your servers once in MCPGateway and let Claude, Cursor, Codex, or your own Agents connect to a single MCP endpoint.

## Why MCPGateway?

MCP is powerful, but managing many MCP servers gets messy fast.

Without a gateway:

- 🔌 Every client needs its own MCP server configuration
- 🧩 Tools, prompts, and resources are scattered across different servers
- 🔐 Access control is duplicated or missing
- 👥 Teams have no shared view of available MCP tools
- 🛠️ Local setups become hard to reproduce

MCPGateway gives you a single control point:

- 🌐 One MCP endpoint for Claude, Cursor, Copilot, and custom agents
- 🗂️ One place to register and manage MCP servers
- 🔎 Unified discovery for tools, prompts, and resources
- 🎛️ Optional tool groups to expose only the tools a client should see
- 📊 Simple access-control and observability hooks for shared deployments

Start with a local setup. Scale to a shared team gateway when you need it.

## Documentation
 Mcpgateway documentation has a new home: [https://docs.mcpgateway.com](https://docs.mcpgateway.com).
 
 Please prefer the docs site over this README for the latest guides, reference, and operational details.
 
 Your AI Clients can also access the docs using its MCP server `https://docs.mcpgateway.com/mcp`!

## Quickstart

This quickstart guide will show you how to:
1. Start the mcpgateway server locally using `docker compose`
2. Add an MCP server in mcpgateway
3. Connect your Claude Desktop to mcpgateway to access your MCP tools

### Start the server
Fetch the `docker-compose.yaml` and start the mcpgateway server:
```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

This exposes mcpgateway's streamable http mcp server at `http://localhost:8080/mcp` by default.

### Add an MCP server
1. Download the `mcpgateway` CLI on your local machine either using brew or directly from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/releases).
```bash
brew install mcpgateway/mcpgateway/mcpgateway
```

 2. Add the [context7](https://context7.com/) MCP server to mcpgateway using the CLI:
```bash
mcpgateway register --name context7 --url https://mcp.context7.com/mcp
```

You should see output similar to this:

![register-context7](./docs/images/register-context7.png)

### Connect to mcpgateway

In your Claude Desktop, add the configuration for mcpgateway MCP server:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpgateway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Once you have added the configuration, try asking claude something simple: 
```text
Use context7 to get the documentation for `/lodash/lodash`
```

Claude will then attempt to call the `context7__get-library-docs` tool via MCPGateway, which will return the documentation for the Lodash library.

<p align="center">
  <img src="./assets/quickstart-claude-call-tool.png" alt="claude calls context7 tool via mcpgateway" height="400">
</p>

You now have a working MCP setup with a single unified endpoint!

Next, explore the complete documentation at [docs.mcpgateway.com](https://docs.mcpgateway.com/) and the [public roadmap](https://docs.mcpgateway.com/roadmap).

# Installation
MCPGateway is shipped as a stand-alone binary.

You can either download it from the [Releases](https://github.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/releases) Page or use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install it:

```bash
brew install mcpgateway/mcpgateway/mcpgateway
```

Verify your installation by running

```bash
mcpgateway version
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> On MacOS, you will have to use homebrew because the compiled binary is not [Notarized](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/notarizing-macos-software-before-distribution) yet.

MCPGateway provides a Docker image which is useful for running the registry server (more about it later).

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/mcpgateway/mcpgateway
```

# Usage
MCPGateway has a Client-Server architecture and the binary lets you run both the Server and the Client.

## Server
The MCPGateway server is responsible for managing all the MCP servers registered in it and providing a unified MCP gateway for AI Agents to discover and call tools provided by these registered servers.

The gateway itself runs over streamable http transport and is accessible at the `/mcp` endpoint.

### Running inside Docker
For running the MCPGateway server locally, docker compose is the recommended way:
```shell
# docker-compose.yaml is optimized for individuals running mcpgateway on their local machines for personal use.
# mcpgateway will run in `development` mode by default.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml

docker compose up -d

# docker-compose.prod.yaml is optimized for orgs deploying mcpgateway on a remote server for multiple users.
# mcpgateway will run in `enterprise` mode by default, which enables enterprise features.
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.prod.yaml

docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> The `enterprise` mode used to be called `production` mode.
> The mode has now been renamed for clarity. Everything else remains the same.

This will start the MCPGateway server along with a persistent Postgres database container.

You can quickly verify that the server is running:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/health
```

If you plan on registering stdio-based MCP servers that rely on `npx` or `uvx`, use mcpgateway's `stdio` tagged docker image instead.
```bash
MCPGATEWAY_IMAGE_TAG=latest-stdio docker compose up -d
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you're using `docker-compose.yaml`, this is already the default image tag.
> You only need to specify the stdio image tag if you're using `docker-compose.prod.yaml`.

This image is significantly larger. But it is very convenient and recommended for running locally when you rely on stdio-based MCP servers.

For example, if you only want to register remote mcp servers like context7 and deepwiki, you can use the standard (minimal) image.

But if you also want to use stdio-based servers like `filesystem`, `time`, `github`, etc., you should use the `stdio`-tagged image instead.

> [!NOTE]
> If your stdio servers rely on tools other than `npx` or `uvx`, you will have to create a custom docker image that includes those dependencies along with the mcpgateway binary.

**Production Deployment**

The default [MCPGateway Docker image](https://ghcr.io/mcpgateway/mcpgateway) is very lightweight - it only contains a minimal base image and the `mcpgateway` binary.

It is therefore suitable and recommended for production deployments.

For the database, we recommend you deploy a separate Postgres DB cluster and supply its endpoint to mcpgateway (see [Database](#database) section below).

You can see the definitions of the [standard Docker image](./Dockerfile) and the [stdio Docker image](./stdio.Dockerfile).

### Running directly on host
You can also run the server directly on your host machine using the binary:

```bash
mcpgateway start
```

This starts the main registry server and MCP gateway, accessible on port `8080` by default.

### Shutting down
It is important that the mcpgateway server shuts down gracefully to ensure proper cleanup.

The recommended way to stop the server process is to send a `SIGTERM` signal to it.



### Database
The mcpgateway server relies on a database and by default, creates a SQLite DB file `mcpgateway.db` in the current working directory.

This is okay when you're just testing things out locally.

For more serious deployments, mcpgateway also supports Postgresql. You can supply the DSN to connect to it:

```bash
# You can supply the database DSN as an env var
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://admin:root@localhost:5432/mcpgateway_db

#run as container
docker run ghcr.io/mcpgateway/mcpgateway:latest

# or run directly
mcpgateway start
```

You can also supply postgres-specific env vars or files if you don't prefer using the DSN:
```bash
# host is mandatory if you're using postgres-specific env vars
export POSTGRES_HOST=localhost
export POSTGRES_PORT=5432

export POSTGRES_USER=admin
export POSTGRES_USER_FILE=/path/to/user-file

export POSTGRES_PASSWORD=secret
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD_FILE=/path/to/password-file

export POSTGRES_DB=mcpgateway_db
export POSTGRES_DB_FILE=/path/to/db-file

mcpgateway start
```

## Client
Once the server is up, you can use the mcpgateway CLI to interact with it.

MCPGateway currently supports MCP servers using [stdio](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#stdio) and [Streamable HTTP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http) Transports.

> [!NOTE]
> Support for SSE (server-sent events) also exists but is currently not mature.

Let's see how to register them in mcpgateway.

### Registering streamable HTTP-based servers
Let's say you're already running a streamable http MCP server locally at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp` which provides basic math tools like `add`, `subtract`, etc.

You can register this MCP server with MCPGateway:
```bash
mcpgateway register --name calculator --description "Provides some basic math tools" --url http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp
```

If you used docker compose to run the server, and you're not on Linux, you will have to use `host.docker.internal` instead of your local loopback address.
```bash
mcpgateway register --name calculator --description "Provides some basic math tools" --url http://host.docker.internal:8000/mcp
```

The registry will now start tracking this MCP server and load its tools.

![register a MCP server in MCPGateway](./assets/register-mcp-server.png)

You can also provide a configuration file to register the MCP server:
```bash
cat ./calculator.json
{
  "name": "calculator",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "description": "Provides some basic math tools",
  "url": "http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp"
}

mcpgateway register -c ./calculator.json
```

All tools provided by this server are now accessible via MCPGateway:

```bash
mcpgateway list tools

# Check tool usage
mcpgateway usage calculator__multiply

# Call a tool
mcpgateway invoke calculator__multiply --input '{"a": 100, "b": 50}'
```

![Call a tool via MCPGateway Proxy MCP server](./assets/tool-call.png)

> [!NOTE]
> A tool in MCPGateway must be referred to by its canonical name which follows the pattern `<mcp-server-name>__<tool-name>`.
> Server name and tool name are separated by a double underscore `__`.
>
> eg- If you register a MCP server `github` which provides a tool called `git_commit`, you can invoke it in MCPGateway using the name `github__git_commit`.
> 
> Your MCP client must also use this canonical name to call the tool via MCPGateway.

The config file format for registering a Streamable HTTP-based MCP server is:
```json
{
  "name": "<name of your mcp server>",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "description": "<description>",
  "url": "<url of the mcp server>",
  "bearer_token": "<optional bearer token for authentication>",
  "headers": {
    "<custom http header>": "<value>"
  }
}
```

### Registering STDIO-based servers

Here's an example configuration file (let's call it `filesystem.json`) for a MCP server that uses the STDIO transport:

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "description": "filesystem mcp server",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."]
}
```

You can register this MCP server in MCPGateway by providing the configuration file:
```bash
# Save the JSON configuration to a file (e.g., filesystem.json)
mcpgateway register -c ./filesystem.json
```

The config file format for registering a STDIO-based MCP server is:

```json
{
  "name": "<name of your mcp server>",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "description": "<description>",
  "command": "<command to run the mcp server, eg- 'npx', 'uvx'>",
  "args": ["arguments", "to", "pass", "to", "the", "command"],
  "env": {
    "KEY": "value"
  }
}
```

You can also watch a quick video on [How to register a STDIO-based MCP server](https://youtu.be/YqHiuexR5fw).

> [!TIP]
> If your STDIO server fails or throws errors for some reason, check the mcpgateway server's logs to view its `stderr` output.

#### Environment variables in JSON config files

When you use a JSON config file to register a mcp server or create other entities like tol groups, the CLI can resolve environment variable placeholders in string values before sending the request to the server.

- Only placeholders written as `${VAR_NAME}` are resolved.
- Placeholders can appear anywhere inside a string value, for example `prefix-${VAR_NAME}-suffix`.
- Resolution happens in the CLI process, so the environment variable must be available where you run the command.
- If a referenced environment variable is not set, the command fails with an error.
- This applies to string fields across the JSON config, including nested objects and string arrays.

Example MCP server config:

```json
{
  "name": "affine-main",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "description": "AFFiNE workspace MCP server",
  "url": "https://app.affine.pro/api/workspaces/${AFFINE_WORKSPACE_ID}/mcp",
  "bearer_token": "${AFFINE_API_TOKEN}",
  "headers": {
    "X-Workspace": "${AFFINE_WORKSPACE_ID}"
  }
}
```

Example STDIO config:

```json
{
  "name": "my-stdio-server",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "uvx",
  "args": ["my-server", "--workspace", "${WORKSPACE_ID}"],
  "env": {
    "API_TOKEN": "${API_TOKEN}"
  }
}
```

**Caveat** ⚠️

When running mcpgateway inside Docker, you need some extra configuration to run the `filesystem` mcp server.

By default, mcpgateway inside container does not have access to your host filesystem.

So you must:
- mount the host directory you want to access as a volume in the container
- specify the mount path as the directory in the filesystem mcp server command args

The `docker-compose.yaml` provided by mcpgateway mounts the current working directory as `/host` in the container.

So you can use the following configuration for the filesystem mcp server:

```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/host"]
}
```

Then, the mcp has access to `/host`, ie, the current working directory on your host machine.

See [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md#docker-filesystem-access) for more details.

#### Running CLI commands from a Docker or Kubernetes deployment
If your MCPGateway server is running in a remote Docker container or Kubernetes cluster, you can also execute the `mcpgateway` binary directly inside the container:

```bash
docker exec -it <container_name> /mcpgateway
kubectl -n <namespace> exec -it po/<pod_name> -- /mcpgateway
```

> [!NOTE]
> The standard image does not include a shell. Run `/mcpgateway` directly via `docker exec` or `kubectl exec`.

This is useful for running CLI commands from the same environment where the server is running.

### Deregistering MCP servers
You can remove a MCP server from mcpgateway.

```bash
mcpgateway deregister calculator
mcpgateway deregister filesystem
```

Once removed, this mcp server and its tools are no longer available to you or your MCP clients.

### Configuring a custom registry URL

By default, the CLI connects to the mcpgateway server at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

If your server is running on a different host or port (e.g., a remote deployment), you can configure the registry URL in two ways:

**Option 1: Use the `--registry` flag**
```bash
mcpgateway --registry http://my-server:9000 list tools
```

**Option 2: Set it in the config file**

Create or edit `~/.mcpgateway.conf`:
```yaml
registry_url: http://my-server:9000
```

This avoids having to pass the `--registry` flag on every command.


## Cold-start problem & Stateful Connections
By default, MCPGateway always creates a new connection with the upstream MCP server when a tool is called.

When the tool call is complete, the connection is closed.

This keeps the system clean and avoids memory leaks.

But sometimes this can cause a latency overhead. For eg- a new process is spawned every time you call a tool of a STDIO-based mcp server. If the server takes several seconds to start up, this slows down the tool call and the overall interaction.

To solve this, MCPGateway also supports stateful connections.

You can set the `session_mode` to `stateful` (default is `stateless`) in you MCP server configuration:
```json
{
  "name": "filesystem",
  "transport": "stdio",
  "command": "npx",
  "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "."],
  "session_mode": "stateful"
}
```

mcpgateway will create a new connection with this mcp server **the first time you call one of its tools**.

This connection is not closed when the tool call is complete. Subsequent tool calls to this server reuse the same connection, avoiding the cold-start overhead.

The connection is only closed when:
1. mcpgateway server is stopped
2. the mcp server is deregistered from mcpgateway
3. the connection times out after a period of inactivity. You can set the number of seconds using the `SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SEC` env var to configure this globally in mcpgateway server (default value is -1, which means no timeout).

When possible, it is recommended that you use stateless connections (default setting).

## Integration with other MCP Clients
Assuming that MCPGateway is running on `http://localhost:8080`, use the following configurations to connect to it:

### Claude
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpgateway": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-remote",
        "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
        "--allow-http"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpgateway": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

You can watch a quick video on [How to connect Cursor to MCPGateway](https://youtu.be/SaUqj-eLPnw).

### Copilot

Follow Copilot's doc on [configuraing a MCP server manually](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/provide-context/use-mcp/extend-copilot-chat-with-mcp#configuring-mcp-servers-manually-1).

Your mcp.json config file should look like this after adding mcpgateway to it:
```json
{
  "servers": {
    "mcpgateway": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> You may have to click on `Start` for Copilot to actually start interacting with mcpgateway.

## Enabling/Disabling Tools
You can disable and re-enable a specific tool or all the tools provided by an MCP Server.

If a tool is disabled, it is not available via the MCPGateway Proxy or any of the Tool Groups, so no MCP clients can view or call it.

You can disable and enable Prompts as well.

```bash
# disable the `get-library-docs` tool provided by the `context7` MCP server
mcpgateway disable tool context7__get-library-docs

# re-enable the tool
mcpgateway enable tool context7__get-library-docs

# disable all tools in context7
mcpgateway disable tool context7

# disable the whole `context7` MCP server (disables all tools & prompts)
mcpgateway disable server context7

# re-enable `context7`
mcpgateway enable server context7

# disable a prompt
mcpgateway disable prompt "huggingface_Model Details"

# disable all prompts in context7
mcpgateway disable prompt context7
```

A disabled tool is still accessible via mcpgateway's HTTP API, so humans can still manage it from the CLI (or any other HTTP client).

> [!NOTE]
> When a new server is registered in MCPGateway, all its tools & prompts are **enabled** by default.

## Prompts
Mcpgateway supports [Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts).

When you register a new MCP server, if it provides prompts, they're registered in mcpgateway too.

Here are some examples of how you can interact with Prompts using the CLI:
```bash
# list all prompts provided by the huggingface mcp
$ mcpgateway list prompts --server huggingface

# Retrieve the "Model Details" prompt, supply custom arguments
$ mcpgateway get prompt "huggingface__Model Details" --arg model_id="openai/gpt-oss-120b"
```

## Tool Groups
As you add more MCP servers to MCPGateway, the number of tools available through the Gateway can grow significantly.

If your MCP client is exposed to hundreds of tools through the gateway MCP, its performance may degrade.

MCPGateway allows you to **expose only a subset of all available tools to your MCP clients using Tool Groups**.

You can create a new group and only include specific tools that you wish to expose.

Once a group is created, mcpgateway returns a unique endpoint for it.

You can then configure your MCP client to use this group-specific endpoint instead of the main gateway endpoint.

### Security on group MCP URLs

Each **tool group** and **prompt group** has a `security_option` field: `open`, `api_key`, `basic` (default), or `bearer`. It controls how clients authenticate to that group's MCP routes (`/v0/groups/{name}/…` and `/v0/prompt-groups/{name}/…`) in **all** server modes, including development. The global `/mcp` endpoint is unchanged. Use `open` only when the network path is already trusted.

### Creating a Tool Group
You can create a new tool group by providing a JSON configuration file to the `create group` command.

You must specify a unique `name` for the group and define which tools to include using one or more of the following fields:
- **`included_tools`**: List specific tool names to include (e.g., `["filesystem__read_file", "time__get_current_time"]`)
- **`included_servers`**: Include ALL tools from specific MCP servers (e.g., `["time", "deepwiki"]`)
- **`excluded_tools`**: Exclude specific tools (useful when including entire servers)

#### Example 1: Cherry-picking specific tools
Here is an example of a tool group configuration file (`claude-tools-group.json`):
```json
{
  "name": "claude-tools",
  "description": "This group only contains tools for Claude Desktop to use",
  "included_tools": [
    "filesystem__read_file",
    "deepwiki__read_wiki_contents",
    "time__get_current_time"
  ]
}
```

This group exposes only 3 handpicked tools instead of all available tools.

#### Example 2: Including entire servers with exclusions
You can also include all tools from specific servers and optionally exclude some:
```json
{
  "name": "claude-tools",
  "description": "All tools from time and deepwiki servers except time__convert_time",
  "included_servers": ["time", "deepwiki"],
  "excluded_tools": ["time__convert_time"]
}
```

This includes ALL tools from the `time` and `deepwiki` servers except `time__convert_time`.

#### Example 3: Mixing approaches
You can combine all three fields for maximum flexibility:
```json
{
  "name": "comprehensive-tools",
  "description": "Mix of manual tools, server inclusion, and exclusions",
  "included_tools": ["filesystem__read_file"],
  "included_servers": ["time"],
  "excluded_tools": ["time__convert_time"]
}
```

This includes `filesystem__read_file` plus all tools from the `time` server except `time__convert_time`.

You can create this group in mcpgateway:
```bash
$ mcpgateway create group -c ./claude-tools-group.json

Tool Group claude-tools created successfully
It is now accessible at the following streamable http endpoint:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/v0/groups/claude-tools/mcp

```

You can then configure Claude (or any other MCP client) to use this group-specific endpoint to access the MCP server.

The client will then ONLY see and be able to use these 3 tools and will not be aware of any other tools registered in MCPGateway.

> [!TIP]
> You can run `mcpgateway list tools` to view all available tools and pick the ones you want to include in your group.

You can also watch a [Video on using Tool Groups](https://youtu.be/A21rfGgo38A).

> [!NOTE]
> The exclusion is always applied at the end.
> So if you add a tool to `included_tools` and also list it in `excluded_tools`, it will be excluded from the final group.

#### Limitation 🚧
[Prompts](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-06-18/server/prompts) are currently not supported in Tool Groups. We're working to fix this [issue](https://github.com/mcpgateway/MCPGateway/issues/136) 🛠️

### Managing tool groups
You can currently perform operations like listing all groups, viewing details of a specific group and deleting a group.

```bash
# list all tool groups
mcpgateway list groups

# view details of a specific group
mcpgateway get group claude-tools

# delete a group
mcpgateway delete group claude-tools
```

### Working with tools in groups
You can list and invoke tools within specific groups using the `--group` flag:

```bash
# list tools in a specific group
mcpgateway list tools --group claude-tools

# invoke a tool from a specific group context
mcpgateway invoke filesystem__read_file --group claude-tools --input '{"path": "README.md"}'
```

These commands provide group-scoped operations, making it easier to work with tools within specific contexts and validate that tools are available in your groups.

> [!NOTE]
> If a tool is included in a group but is later disabled globally or deleted, then it will not be available via the group's MCP endpoint.
>
> But if the tool is re-enabled or added again later, it will automatically become available in the group again.

**Limitations** 🚧
1. Currently, you cannot update an existing tool group. You must delete the group and create a new one with the modified configuration file.
2. In `enterprise` mode, currently only an admin can create a Tool Group. We're working on allowing standard Users to create their own groups as well.

## Authentication
MCPGateway currently supports authentication if your Streamable HTTP MCP Server accepts static tokens for auth.

This is useful when using SaaS-provided MCP Servers like HuggingFace, Stripe, etc. which require your API token for authentication.

You can supply your token while registering the MCP server:
```bash
# If you specify the `--bearer-token` flag, MCPGateway will add the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to all requests made to this MCP server.
mcpgateway register --name huggingface --description "HuggingFace MCP Server" --url https://huggingface.co/mcp --bearer-token <your-hf-api-token>
```

Or from your configuration file
```bash
{
  "name": "huggingface",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "url": "https://huggingface.co/mcp",
  "description": "hugging face mcp server",
  "bearer_token": "<your-hf-api-token>"
}
```

If you need to supply a custom value for the `Authorization` header or add additional custom headers, you can use the `headers` field in the config file:
```json
{
  "name": "sourcegraph",
  "transport": "streamable_http",
  "url": "https://sourcegraph.mycompany.com/.api/mcp",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "token <your-sourcegraph-token>",
    "Custom-Header": "custom-value"
  }
}
```

Support for Oauth flow is coming soon!

## Enterprise Features 🔒

If you're running MCPGateway in your organisation, we recommend running the Server in the `enterprise` mode:
```bash
# enable enterprise features by running in enterprise mode
mcpgateway start --enterprise

# you can also specify the server mode as environment variable (valid values are `development` and `enterprise`)
export SERVER_MODE=enterprise
mcpgateway start

# Or use the enterprise-mode docker compose file as described above
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yaml up -d
```

By default, mcpgateway server runs in `development` mode which is ideal for individuals running it locally.

In Enterprise mode, the server enforces stricter security policies and will provide additional features like Authentication, ACLs, observability and more.

After starting the server in enterprise mode, you must initialize it by running the following command on your client machine:
```bash
mcpgateway init-server
```

This will create an admin user in the server and store its API access token in your home directory (`~/.mcpgateway.conf`).

You can then use the mcpgateway cli to make authenticated requests to the server.

### Access Control

In `development` mode, all MCP clients have full access to all the MCP servers registered in MCPGateway Proxy.

`enterprise` mode lets you control which MCP clients can access which MCP servers.

Suppose you have registered 2 MCP servers `calculator` and `github` in MCPGateway in enterprise mode.

By default, no MCP client can access these servers. **You must create an MCP Client in mcpgateway and explicitly allow it to access the MCP servers.**

```bash
# Create a new MCP client for your Cursor IDE to use. It can access the calculator and github MCP servers
mcpgateway create mcp-client cursor-local --allow "calculator, github"

MCP client 'cursor-local' created successfully!
Servers accessible: calculator,github

Access token: 1YHf2LwE1LXtp5lW_vM-gmdYHlPHdqwnILitBhXE4Aw
Send this token in the `Authorization: Bearer {token}` HTTP header.
```

Mcpgateway creates an access token for your client.
Configure your client or agent to send this token in the `Authorization` header when making requests to the mcpgateway proxy.

> [!TIP]
> You can also supply a custom access token for your mcp clients and user accounts using the `--access-token` flag.
> This is useful when you want to manage tokens yourself, perhaps through a central identity server.

For example, you can add the following configuration in Cursor to connect to MCPGateway:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mcpgateway": {
      "url": "http://localhost:8080/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer 1YHf2LwE1LXtp5lW_vM-gmdYHlPHdqwnILitBhXE4Aw"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

A client that has access to a particular server this way can view and call all the tools provided by that server.

> [!NOTE]
> If you don't specify the `--allow` flag, the MCP client will not be able to access any MCP servers.

#### Creating mcp clients from the config file
You can also create an MCP client by providing a JSON configuration file:
```json
{
	"name": "foobar",
	"allowed_servers": ["deepwiki", "time"],
	"access_token": "my_secret_token_123",
    "access_token_ref": {
        "file": "/path/to/token-file.txt",
        "env": "ENV_VAR_NAME"
    }
}
```

When creating a client from a config file, you **must** provide a custom access token because mcpgateway cannot print the generated token to the console.

#### Supplying custom access tokens in config files

There are 3 ways to provide the access token from configuration file:

1. Directly in the `access_token` field: Only use this for testing purposes. Not recommended for production, especially if you're committing the config file to version control.
2. From a file using the `access_token_ref.file` field: The file should contain only the token string.
3. From an environment variable using the `access_token_ref.env` field: The env var should contain the token string.

You can also use `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders elsewhere in the same JSON config file. For example:

```json
{
  "name": "${MCP_CLIENT_NAME}",
  "allowed_servers": ["${PRIMARY_SERVER}", "time"],
  "access_token_ref": {
    "env": "CLIENT_TOKEN_ENV_NAME"
  }
}
```

#### Creating user accounts
In addition to MCP clients, you can also create User accounts in mcpgateway for human users.

A user has a very limited set of privileges compared to an admin in the enterprise mode.
For example, they can view and use MCP servers, but they don't have write permissions in mcpgateway.

```bash
# Auto-generates a secret for user
mcpgateway create user bob
# Specify a custom access token for user
mcpgateway create user alice --access-token alice_token_123
# Create user from config file
mcpgateway create user --conf /path/to/user-config.json
```

The config file format for creating a user is similar to that of an MCP client:
```json
{
    "name": "charlie",
    "access_token": "charlies_secret_token",
    "access_token_ref": {
        "file": "/path/to/token-file.txt",
        "env": "ENV_VAR_NAME"
    }
}
```

Again, when using the config file, you **must** provide a custom access token.

Just like other JSON config files in MCPGateway, user config files also support `${VAR_NAME}` placeholders in string fields.

### OpenTelemetry
MCPGateway supports Prometheus-compatible OpenTelemetry Metrics for observability.

- In `enterprise` mode, OpenTelemetry is enabled by default.
- In `development` mode, telemetry is disabled by default. You can enable it by setting the `OTEL_ENABLED` environment variable to `true` before starting the server:

```bash
# enable OpenTelemetry metrics
export OTEL_ENABLED=true

# optionally, set additional attributes to be added to all metrics
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES=deployment.environment.name=enterprise

# start the server
mcpgateway start
```

Once the mcpgateway server is started, metrics are available at the `/metrics` endpoint.

# Current limitations 🚧
We're not perfect yet, but we're working hard to get there!

### 1. MCPGateway does not support OAuth flow for authentication yet
This is a work in progress.

We're collecting more feedback on how people use OAuth with MCP servers, so feel free to start a Discussion or open an issue to share your use case.
